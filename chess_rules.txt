X piece movement
X capturing

castling:
    X king and the rook must not be moved
    X the king must not be in check
    X no square between king's start and final square may be controlled by the enemy

    X castling does not reset half move clock

pawns:
    X first move can be double-jump
    X capture different than move
    X en passant
    X promotion

check:
    X must prevent checkmate
    X no check by king

draw:
    X not in check and no legal move
    X dead positions (k vs k, k vs k&bishop, k vs k&knight, k&bishop vs k&bishop on same color)
    *fivefold repetition rule
    X seventy-five-move rule
    need to ask:
        *threefold repetition rule
        X fifty-move rule

will not implement three and five fold repetition move as it is unlikely to happen
and we do not have information about previous board positions
